## Project Description

The **Placement Intelligence Assistant** is a full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built on top of the SVECW Placement Dataset for RAG-ATHON 24.

It answers student placement queries — eligibility filtering, package comparisons, interview preparation, trend analysis, conflict detection, and multi-hop reasoning — with grounded, hallucination-resistant answers powered by Groq's Llama-3.1 model.

The system handles every content modality present in the PDF:

- **Structured tables** — eligibility criteria, hiring distribution, overall statistics
- **Free-text narratives** — interview experiences split per round
- **Bar chart images** — rendered as PNG and described by Groq vision model
- **Temporal trend data** — package growth per company per year (2021–2024)
- **Conflicting records** — intentionally mismatched official vs portal data
- **Out-of-corpus questions** — routed to tools instead of hallucinating

Each content type gets its own chunking, retrieval, and reasoning strategy — exactly as specified in Section 10 of the dataset PDF.

---

## Why This Project

Standard RAG systems fail on placement datasets for several reasons:

- PDF tables get merged into garbled text by naive parsers
- Bar charts are vector graphics invisible to text extractors
- The same company data appears from two sources with different values
- Some questions have no answer in the document and need graceful fallback
- Aggregation queries like "highest paying" need reasoning across many chunks
- Time-based queries like "grew the most since 2021" need year-tagged metadata

This project solves all of the above with a layered, modular architecture built on SOLID principles. Every stage is abstracted behind an interface so components can be swapped without touching the pipeline.

---

## Features

- **Hybrid Search** — Dense FAISS embeddings plus sparse BM25 combined with Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- **CrossEncoder Reranking** — `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` for high-precision reranking after broad retrieval
- **Vision Chart Support** — Groq `llama-4-scout` reads bar charts and trend graphs rendered as page images
- **Content-Aware Chunking** — Six different chunking strategies based on content type, following Section 10 of the dataset exactly
- **TF-IDF Deduplication** — Reduces 400+ raw chunks to 80–120 meaningful ones using cosine similarity
- **Conflict Detection** — Flags official vs portal source disagreements and never silently returns one value
- **Fallback Guard** — Out-of-corpus queries receive honest "not in documents" responses
- **AIMD Overshadow Limiter** — Binary-search context cap prevents hallucination from context overload
- **Temporal Reasoning** — Year-tagged trend chunks enable growth calculations across 2021–2024
- **Aggregation Query Boosting** — Injects all relevant section chunks for highest/lowest/best comparisons
- **Multi-Hop Reasoning** — Structured step-by-step filtering across eligibility, hiring, and package data
- **Tool-Augmented Agent** — Web search, calculator, date, and opinion guard tools for unanswerable questions
- **Query Rewriting** — Expands each query into 2–4 variants for better recall
- **Query Caching** — `@st.cache_data` with 1-hour TTL; response time naturally shows cache effect
- **Persistent Chat History** — ChatGPT-style sidebar history saved to disk and restored on reload
- **34-Query Evaluator** — Automated scoring across Easy, Medium, Hard, Expert, and Multi-hop difficulty levels
- **Rate Limit Protection** — Auto-retry with backoff on Groq API 429 errors

## How to Use the Project

### Asking questions

Type any placement-related question in the input box and click **Ask**. The system retrieves relevant chunks, reranks them, and generates a grounded answer.

### Quick test queries

The sidebar contains pre-loaded queries covering every difficulty level. Click any of them to instantly populate the input box and run the query.

### Reading the answer

| Box colour | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green | Standard grounded answer from documents |
| Red | Conflicting data detected between official and portal sources |
| Yellow | Out-of-corpus — information not available in the documents |

### Diagnostics

Expand the **Retrieval Diagnostics** section under any answer to see retrieval quality score, context tokens, overshadow risk, and self-consistency score.

### Chat history

All previous questions appear below the current answer, newest first. The sidebar also shows a clickable history list. Reloading the page preserves history — it is saved automatically to `data/chat_history.json`.

### Response time

Each answer shows its response time. Repeated questions show near-zero response time because they are served from the 1-hour cache — no extra API call is made.

### Running the evaluation suite

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
```

Runs all 34 queries and saves results to:

```
data/eval_results.csv
data/multihop_results.csv
```

## RAG Pipeline — 6 Stages

| Stage | Name | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Rewrite** | Expands query into 2–4 variants for better recall |
| 2 | **Retrieve** | Hybrid BM25 + FAISS with RRF fusion and metadata boosting |
| 3 | **Rerank** | CrossEncoder scores every (query, chunk) pair for precision |
| 4 | **Refine** | AIMD overshadow limiter caps context to 500–1500 token sweet spot |
| 5 | **Insert** | Grounded prompt built with query-type specific instructions |
| 6 | **Generate** | Groq Llama-3.1 generates answer with self-consistency check |

Before Stage 1, a **Tool Router** classifies the query. Out-of-corpus queries are sent directly to tools instead of entering the RAG pipeline.

---

## Chunking Strategy

Implemented exactly per Section 10 of the dataset PDF:

| Content Type | Strategy | Chunk Size | Key Metadata |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eligibility table | 1 company = 1 chunk | ~80 tokens | `company`, `section=eligibility` |
| Interview experiences | Paragraph split per round | 200–300 tokens | `company`, `round_number` |
| Hiring distribution | 1 company = 1 chunk | ~60 tokens | `chart_type=hiring` |
| Trend data | 1 company per year | ~40 tokens | `company`, `year` |
| Conflict records | Both versions stored | ~50 tokens | `source=official/portal`, `conflict=True` |
| Chart images | Groq vision → text | ~100 tokens | `source=vision` |
| Adversarial queries | **Not embedded** | — | Evaluation only |

An unoptimised pipeline on this document produces 400+ chunks. After content-aware chunking and TF-IDF deduplication, this system produces 119 meaningful chunks.

---

## Tool-Augmented Agent

For questions the RAG corpus cannot answer, the tool router dispatches to the appropriate tool:

| Tool | Triggers | Example query |
|---|---|---|
| `web_search` | Campus dates, schedules, real-time info | *"When will TCS visit SVECW?"* |
| `calculator` | Ratios, eligibility, below-threshold CGPA | *"I have CGPA 5.0, where can I apply?"* |
| `current_date` | Date and time queries | *"What is today's date?"* |
| `opinion_guard` | Subjective career questions | *"Should I join Google or Microsoft?"* |

Calculator and opinion guard answers are supplemented with RAG context where available.

---

## Evaluation Results

Scores on 34 official queries (30 from Section 9 + 4 multi-hop from Section 4):

| Difficulty | Score | Queries |
|---|---|---|
| Easy | 87.5% | 8 |
| Medium | 78.2% | 10 |
| Hard | 78.6% | 7 |
| Expert | 73.4% | 5 |
| Multi-hop | 87.5% | 4 |
| **Overall** | **77.9%** | **34** |

Skills scoring 100%: Direct table lookup, Temporal reasoning, Full synthesis, Out-of-corpus fallback, 3-condition filter, Column filter, Hiring table aggregation, Chart/table comparison, Filter + sort, Join: tech + hiring, Multi-attribute comparison, Text retrieval + synthesis.
